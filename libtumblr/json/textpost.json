I&#8217;ll still be putting just as much effort into making the comic, but the time I have to do so has been greatly reduced.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully once the semester is over I&#8217;ll be able to resume a panel a day for at least the winter break, until then I&#8217;ll continue to post the pages and other work on tumblr as it&#8217;s ready.</p>",

I hate to be the pessimist here, I mean New Year\u2019s is fun and everything (or at least I assume it is for people with friends), but I just find it weird to get this excited about it. We as humans decided what days were, months, and years, etc. At least they were based on astronomical activity, but still, there\u2019s not actually such a thing as time or dates or anything. We just kind of said, \u201cOkay, this is going to be the first day of the year.\u201d Why is that something to celebrate? I mean we could say like\u2026April 3 was the start of the year and celebrate them. It\u2019s a celebration of something we decided. And it\u2019s not like something actually happens on New Year\u2019s. It\u2019s no different than yesterday. And we use it as this excuse to start over and try again, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re actually being cleaned of our past mistakes and given another chance. It\u2019s basically saying, \u201cWell, I fucked up a lot in 2009, maybe 2010 will be good.\u201d Why don\u2019t we just \u201cstart clean\u201d on one day at random, by decision? Not by a specific made up date. I dunno, I\u2019ve just been thinking about this a lot lately, it can boggle the mind. Why I think about it, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just going to go with the flow of life as it is and not worry about what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. So I sincerely wish everyone a happy new year.</p>\n<p>-Niko</p></blockquote>\n\n\nIt&#8217;s a good excuse for a party, other than that it&#8217;s kind of meaningless tradition, but structure and regularity are supposed to be comforting. Strangely, April 3 is my birthday. It&#8217;d make sense to start the new year at the end of winter though, I guess that&#8217;d be about mid-march?",
