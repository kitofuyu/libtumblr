I figured that instead of squirrelling all the dates away into my google calendar, I could make them publicly accessible. Consider it an extension of the free museum studies resources (Most of the events are free). You can either subscribe to the calendar of visit the tab on museumsandstuff.org where I have embedded it.</p>\n<p>As always, feel free to submit events for the page if they fit the following criteria:</p>\n<p>1. In the general Vienna area (conferences etc in the surrounding Bundesländer also welcome of course!)</p>\n<p>2. Relate in a general way to the work of museums or museum studies.</p>"

Memorial and Museum in New York. Subject to heated discussion and several law suits, families of 9/11 victims have reacted angrily to the plan to bury unidentified human remains underground, behind the wall which bears a Virgil quotation. </p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2011/04/04/911_families_dont_want_911_remains.php\" target=\"_blank\">Gothamist</a>, signifiant consultation was carried out with a coalition of relatives of those killed in the World Trade Center and the families now pressing for the release of names and addresses of other families - so that a comprehensive poll can be carried out - represented the minority opinion. However, those family members feel that the inclusion of the remains in the museum - which would require them to enter through the museum to pay their respects or make an out-of-hours appointment - is inappropriate, forming part of a tourist attraction and demand an above ground memorial to house the remains that is publicly accessible. </p>\n<p>As the remains are not to be displayed, this is a matter relating firmly to the memorial aspect of the project. The Museum&#8217;s Director Alice Greenwald told the New York Times that the precedent of including human remains in atrocity museums has been set, citing <a href=\"http://www.kigalimemorialcentre.org/old/centre/massgraves.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rwanda</a>, <a href=\"http://en.auschwitz.org/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=13\" target=\"_blank\">Auschwitz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tourismcambodia.org/provincial_guide/index.php?view=attdetail&amp;prv=15&amp;att=5&amp;page=2\" target=\"_blank\">Phnom Penh</a>. However - to the best of my knowledge - in these cases the question when developing the memorials and museums on the sites would have been one of whether to <em>move</em> the remains, rather than where to house them as each is the site of mass killing and mass graves. </p>\n<p>Also worth noting, is that the remains repository is not designed to be a permanent solution for all of the remains. Indeed, there will be 2,500 square feet of space to facilitate the continued study of the remains with the hope of making positive identifications. The work space will not be accessible by the public, but family members will have access to a viewing area. The facility will be operated and maintained by the Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office, not by the museum. </p>\n<p>The website set up by the families who disagree with the museum&#8217;s inclusion of human remains below ground can be accessed <a href=\"http://www.respecthumanremainsatthe911memorial.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>The museum has a page which describes how the decision was made and how the remains repository will function.

In many countries, legacies of war, colonialism, genocide and oppression return again and again to dominate contemporary politics, culture and society. The controversies surrounding traumatic pasts can shape policy, make or break governments, trigger mass demonstrations, and even spark violent confrontation. These pasts also inspire rich visual and creative responses, through which the past is remembered, remade and challenged, and the public space of the modern museum is the primary venue for these responses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><span>Museum of Ethnology, Vienna, on the 20th to 22nd November, 2012</span></strong></p>\n<p>Sending a registration email now, see you there? </p>"
