                "text": "The question that’s slightly more radical is the social role of museums. To what extent are they there as a catalyst for change? Are they prepared to fight for some sort of social justice? Do we have a responsibility to reach all sides of society in what we offer? That means working hard to bring in people who wouldn’t normally visit. And leading on from that, should we have a workforce that reflects the community that are paying for us? People who work in museums sometimes say, ‘I didn’t train to be a social worker, I trained to be a curator.’  And of course we don’t want to go too far and lose the object in the middle. But the younger generation of curators is not happy for museums to be places where people come and worship in silence. They want them to be more like town halls, where debates happen, you can speak the unspeakable, and there are things going on. But a museum’s credibility is rooted in the objects.’",

                "text": "The third category is the unlucky ones. After taking a museum-studies course they struggle to get any work at all. They take on more and more voluntary work, perhaps eventually getting a short-term contract post in, for example, documentation. They often end up in jobs they don’t really want because they’re the only ones available. When their first post comes to an end it takes them months to find anything else, and when they do it is often at a similar level. This continues for years, until they eventually are forced to give up on museum work and try a different sector, either because no more jobs are available, or because they have reached perhaps 30 years old, have not progressed and can see no prospect of earning a living wage in museums. In the worst cases, people effectively waste up to 10 years of their life failing to get a reasonable museum job and can become extremely upset, as shown by some of the comments recorded in appendix 2.",

Such organizations, which comprise less than 2 percent of the universe of arts and cultural nonprofits, receive more than half of the sector’s total revenue. These institutions focus primarily on Western European art forms, and their programs serve audiences that are predominantly white and upper income. Only 10 percent of grant dollars made with a primary or secondary purpose of supporting the arts explicitly benefit underserved communities, including lower-income populations, communities of color and other disadvantaged groups. And less than 4 percent focus on advancing social justice goals. These facts suggest that most arts philanthropy is not engaged in addressing inequities that trouble our communities, and is not meeting the needs of our most marginalized populations.",
